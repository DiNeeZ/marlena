                Transshipment and storage complex for loading/discharging and processing of
                all types of mineral fertilizers. It is located directly inside of first cargo
                area of Sea Trade port Reni. The terminal is equipped with high-precision automated
                equipment for mixing, packaging and transshipment of granular mineral fertilizers
                manufactured by EMT company (Netherlands) for dry mixing of mineral fertilizers and
                carry out packaging of bulk mineral fertilizers into bags or big-bags.

              <p>
                This equipment
                can also process various types of bulk cargoes, including polyethylene, polypropylene,
                caprolactam, etc, provide loading of cargo by covered conveyor lines connecting warehouses
                with the loading equipment at the berth for river and seagoing transport, as well as acceptance
                of bulk cargo from water transport, packaging and subsequent loading into road trucks or
                railway wagons. Production capacity of the complex can reach up to 50000 MT per month.
